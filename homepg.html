                Here at The Italian Job we have left no stone unturned to bring the very best of Neapolitan 
                and indeed Italian Pizza to Malta. The flour for the pizza dough comes from Naples’ most 
                respected mill and the mozzarella fior di latte is shipped from Italy each week.

                  There is no secret: pasta is the most common food in the “Bel Paese” – and the most beloved one.
                  The key ingredient of Italian cuisine from North to South, at every age, in every season. 
                  For a long time, at least outside the boot-shaped boundaries of the Italian country, pasta 
                  has been believed to be nothing more than a “guilty (carbohydrate) pleasure”, an unmentionable 
                  taboo for fad diet enthusiasts. Here we make sure to tick all of these entities.

                 Italian wine has been produced for over 4,000 years, being produced in every region of Italy 
                 and home to some of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world. Italy is the world's largest
                 producer of wine, which is why you won't go wrong with our variety if wines.
